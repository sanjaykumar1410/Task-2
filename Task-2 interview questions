1. How do you open and write to a file in Python?

In Python, I use the open() function to open a file. To write, I typically open the file in 'w' or 'a' mode. I prefer using a context manager (with statement), which automatically handles closing the file.
Example:

with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, world!")
-----------------
2. What are common file modes in Python?

The most common file modes are:

'r' for reading (raises error if file doesn't exist),

'w' for writing (creates or overwrites),

'a' for appending (adds to the end, creates if missing),

'r+' for reading and writing.
There’s also 'b' for binary and 't' for text mode.
-------------------
 3. What’s the use of .strip() in Python?

.strip() removes leading and trailing whitespace, including spaces, tabs, and newline characters. It’s useful when reading lines from a file or user input.
-------------------
4. How do lists work in Python?

Lists in Python are ordered, mutable collections. They can store multiple data types and support operations like indexing, slicing, appending, and removing elements.
-------------------
5. What’s the difference between append() and insert()?

append() adds an element to the end of the list.
insert(index, element) adds an element at a specific position.
For example:

lst.append(5)       # Adds at end
lst.insert(0, 1)    # Adds at start
------------------
6. How can you remove elements from a list in Python?

Python provides several ways:

remove(x) deletes the first occurrence of x

pop(i) removes and returns the item at index i

del list[i] deletes an item by index
Each method is useful depending on whether you know the value or the index.
-------------------
7. What are context managers (with statement) used for?

A context manager ensures that resources like files are properly managed.
Using with open(...) ensures that the file is automatically closed, even if an error occurs. It's cleaner and safer than manually opening and closing.
-------------------
8. How do you loop through a file line by line in Python?

I use a for loop directly on the file object:

with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())


This is efficient and memory-friendly, especially for large files.
------------------
9. What is a data structure?

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
In Python, common data structures include:

Lists (ordered, mutable),

Tuples (ordered, immutable),

Sets (unordered, unique),

Dictionaries (key-value pairs).
---------------------
10. What happens if the file doesn’t exist when opening it?

If I open a file in read mode ('r'), Python raises a FileNotFoundError.
If I use write ('w') or append ('a'), Python will create the file automatically if it doesn’t exist.
